# 2048 Projct

In this project, we used C#, XAML, and the .NET framework to create a windows application for the game 2048.

In 2048, there is a 4x4 grid that contains one tile per space. When the game starts, there are two randomly-placed tiles that have the value of eithe 2 or 4.

To start playing, use the arrow keys to move the tiles in the directin of the arrow (down moves tiles to the bottom of the board, left moves tiles to the left, etc.)

When you make a move with the arrow keys, a brand new tile with the value of 2 or 4 is generated in a random unoccupied spot on the board.

The goal of the game is to combine tiles until you reach 2048. Only tiles with the same value (the same power of two) can combine, so 2 can combine with 2, but nothing else. 

Good luck and have fun!
